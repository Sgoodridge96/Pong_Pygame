Description:
This is a recreation of the classic "Pong" game from 1972 for some general python practice. The objective of
the game is to score more points than your opponent by hitting the pong ball behind them. This will give either
player a point. If the score hits 5 or the timer runs out, a game over screen will appear. To replay, the game
must be restarted.

The run:
Run the source code in a IDE of your choice to test the game out.  
Future plans to build an .exe

Bugs:
When the pong ball hits the corner or the player or ai rectangle, the ball will jitter and pick a random direction to go.
Game over screen doesnt display who the winner is.
