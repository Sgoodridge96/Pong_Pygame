Description:
  The idea of this small project is to practice some basic skills and recreate the classic "Pong" game from 1972.
The controls are the arrow keys and the objective of the game is to score more points than your opponent by hitting
the pong ball behind them.  If the pong ball hits the wall behind either player, the last player to hit the ball will
be rewarded a point.  If the time limit ends or 1 player hits 10 points, the game is over.

The run:
Run the source code in a IDE of your choice to test the game out.  
Future plans to build an .exe

Bugs:
no collision with players:  
Add an opponent:  
Show the correct time limit:  
Show and update the score:  
Add a point and reset at the center once the pong ball hits either wall behind the players:  
Implement a game over screen:
